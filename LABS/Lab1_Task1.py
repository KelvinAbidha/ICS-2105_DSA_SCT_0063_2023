'''
Task One 
Define two functions: summation and maximum both of which take an integer array of length
0<= n<= âˆž. The summation function gets the sum of the integers while the maximum function
obtains the largest integer in the array
Within the main function; declare an array of length n, obtain the n from the user, then allow the
user to enter these n integers storing them in the array. Call the two functions in turns and display
their outputs.
